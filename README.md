# Financial-Performance-Dashboard

## Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of sales data in order to evaluate the regional performance of a company. The primary aim is to gain insights into sales trends, assess the influence of discounts, and provide recommendations for optimizing sales strategies across different regions.

## Dataset Summary:
The dataset comprises sales data with the following columns:

Order ID: A unique identifier for each order.

Product ID: A unique identifier for each product.

Sale Date: The date on which the sale was made.

Amount in Sales: The total sales amount.

Discounted Value: The amount of discount applied to the sale.

Region: The geographical region where the sale took place.

## Key Objectives:
The principal objectives of this project are as follows:

**Regional Sales Analysis**: Analyze the sales data to comprehend the performance of each region in terms of sales amounts.

**Discount Impact Assessment**: Evaluate the influence of discounts on sales and pinpoint regions where discounts have the most substantial impact on revenue.


## Data Processing Steps:
To achieve these objectives, the following data processing steps are undertaken:

**1. Data Import**: Import the sales dataset into Microsoft Excel.

**2. Data Cleaning**: Scrutinize the dataset for any missing values, errors, or inconsistencies, and rectify them as needed.

**3. Data Transformation**: Create calculated columns, such as the net sales amount after discount application.

**4. Regional Sales Analysis**:
Group the data by region and calculate the total sales amount for each region.

5. Create visual representations, like bar charts or tables, to illustrate regional sales performance.



## Discount Impact Assessment:

1. Investigate the connection between discounts and sales in each region.

2. Compute the correlation between discounts and sales to measure their impact.

3. Employ visualizations, such as scatter plots, to present the findings.

## Key Insights: 
Based on the analysis of the dataset, the following insights have been derived:

**Regional Sales Performance**: The West region exhibited the highest total sales amount, followed by the East region. The South region had the lowest sales amount among the regions analyzed.

**Discount Impact**: The East region had a significantly higher discount value compared to other regions, which may have contributed to its higher sales. A correlation analysis indicated that discounts had a more pronounced positive impact on sales in the East region.
